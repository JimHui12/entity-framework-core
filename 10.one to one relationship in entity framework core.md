# One-to-One Relationship in entity framework core
## One-to-One relationship
- in context of ef core, if one entity is associated with exactly one record in another entity, it is one-to-one relationship

## Relational database
### In context of relational database: 
if each row in one table has only one related row in another table, it is one-to-one relationship.

## SQL Server
In SQL Server one-to-one relationship can be created using: 
- Primary Key
- Unique foreign key

Principal entity->Primary key
Dependent entity->Foreign key

## Primary Key
- By default, EF Core will assume that a property named "Id" or "{ClassName}Id" (e.g., "EmployeeId") is the primary key of an entity.
- Use data annotations to explicitly specify te primary key property using the [Key] attribute.
- Can also configure the primary key using the Fluent API in the OnModelCreaing method of your DbContext class.
