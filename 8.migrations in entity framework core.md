## Migration
- an ef core feature that provides a way to incrementally update the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while preserving existing data in the database.

## Database creation
- first we create Migration by using Add-Migration command.
- then we create database by using Update-Database command.

## Model Snapshot
- model snapshot file represents current state of a model.
- this file is added to migrations folder when we create first migration
- the file is then updated with each subsequent migration.
